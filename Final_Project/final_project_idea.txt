2. #Identification of Antibiotic Resistance Genes using Bacterial Genome analysis

3. #I would like to identify which bacteria carry antibiotic resistance genes. 
#to do this I would gather genomic data from NCBI and chart the ralation to certain bacteria.
#I plan to incorporate more categories later on, like grouping by families.
#to start I will use a scatter plot, but will likely use a dendrogram or maybe a Circulalr Barplot
